# Webscraping Utilizing NASA info of MARS
## Purpose
This project was developed to collect data from websites through webscraping using python and Mongo DB. The data collection was info from NASA and their unmanned mission to mars. The data collected using python was scraped and stored on Mongo DB that was accessed by Flask app. The extracted data was then showed on an HTML page created to display the findings and optimized for mobile app display.  Bootstrap was used to make additional edits to the webpage.


### Software Used
* Python 
* splinter 
* webdriver-manager 
* Flask

## Results 
This project showed how effective and efficient data collection, storage and accessibility that the process of webscraping can provide for users without them having to access a number of websites. The power of using Python to automate webscrapping to collect data from single or multiple webpages makes it easier for user accessibility. This process can access data from web sources and store it in a database that can be accessed by a user through a webpage. This provides an effective and efficent manner of data collection, storage and accessibility that can provide data for users without them having to access a number of websites.
